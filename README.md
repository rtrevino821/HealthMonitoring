## Synopsis

Our project aims to simplify a patient and their doctor’s relationship. Our goal includes reading its user’s heart rate and logging these data for the patient and their doctor. The doctor will be able to set
parameters that they want their patients to stay within. If any parameter is violated the doctor will be notified.

## Motivation

The project started out as cool toy for kids to record their heart rate. It then grew to become a way for doctors to check on their patient condition post-surgery situations.
